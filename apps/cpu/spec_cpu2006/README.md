# CPU Benchmark Test 
## <a name="1">Introduction</a>
This project focus on cpu performance test. It supply spec cpu2006 cpu test tool, deployment and test method. In this test we </br>
focus on INT and FLOAT calculation. Generally, cpu performance test include two important part, one is speed test, the other is
rate test. Speed test is to test the calculating speed of single-task. Rate test is aimed at testing the throughput capacity of</br>
multiple-task. The two mode have their own Base value and Peak value. In base test, we limit using only one compiler and compile
optimizations no larger than four. In peak test we can using different compiler and compile optimizations in different projects </br>
in order to maxium test results.
